Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download is available from http://matcraft.org/, the official website.

You need Qt (https://www.qt.io/) at least version 5.0 to be able to compile
MatCrossBible. Most Linux distributions normally already package the latest
version of Qt, so it is likely that you need to worry about this. However,
you need the development package as well (sometimes named as qt-devel or
qt5-devel, it varies depends on the distributions).

The simplest way to compile MatCrossBible package is:

1. Extract the source archive.
2.`cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `qmake' to generate the Makefile for your system.
3. Type `make' on Linux or `mingw32-make` on Windows to compile the package.
4. The executable file MatCrossBible (MatCrossBible.exe under Windows) is built on /bin directory.

You can also compile MatCrossBible under Windows throughs `windows-build.bat' script file.
